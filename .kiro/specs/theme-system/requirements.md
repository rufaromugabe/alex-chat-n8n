# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive theme system for the Mutumwa AI application, enabling users to switch between dark and light modes. The current application has hardcoded dark theme colors throughout all components, making it difficult to maintain and impossible for users to choose their preferred theme. This feature will introduce a proper theme architecture using CSS variables, a theme context provider, and a user-friendly theme toggle control.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Theme Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a centralized theme system using CSS variables, so that theme changes can be applied consistently across the entire application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL define comprehensive CSS variables for both light and dark themes in globals.css
2. WHEN a theme is active THEN all color values SHALL be derived from CSS variables rather than hardcoded Tailwind classes
3. IF the theme changes THEN all components SHALL automatically reflect the new theme colors without requiring page refresh
4. WHEN defining CSS variables THEN the system SHALL include variables for: background colors (primary, secondary, tertiary), foreground colors (primary, secondary, muted), border colors, accent colors, and semantic colors (success, warning, error)
5. WHEN organizing CSS variables THEN the system SHALL use a hierarchical naming convention (e.g., --bg-primary, --bg-secondary, --text-primary, --text-secondary)

### Requirement 2: Theme Context and State Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a React context for theme management, so that any component can access and modify the current theme state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application initializes THEN the system SHALL create a ThemeContext that provides theme state and toggle functionality
2. WHEN a user's theme preference is stored THEN the system SHALL persist it to localStorage
3. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL read the theme preference from localStorage or default to system preference
4. IF no stored preference exists THEN the system SHALL detect and apply the user's system theme preference using prefers-color-scheme media query
5. WHEN the theme changes THEN the system SHALL update the document root class to apply the appropriate theme
6. WHEN the ThemeProvider mounts THEN it SHALL prevent flash of unstyled content (FOUC) by applying theme before first render

### Requirement 3: Theme Toggle UI Component

**User Story:** As a user, I want a visible and accessible theme toggle button, so that I can easily switch between dark and light modes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the application header THEN the user SHALL see a theme toggle button with appropriate icons (sun for light mode, moon for dark mode)
2. WHEN the user clicks the theme toggle THEN the system SHALL immediately switch to the opposite theme
3. WHEN the theme changes THEN the toggle icon SHALL update to reflect the current theme state
4. WHEN hovering over the theme toggle THEN the user SHALL see a tooltip indicating the action (e.g., "Switch to light mode")
5. WHEN using keyboard navigation THEN the theme toggle SHALL be accessible via Tab key and activatable via Enter or Space
6. WHEN on mobile devices THEN the theme toggle SHALL be appropriately sized and positioned for touch interaction

### Requirement 4: Component Theme Migration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all existing components updated to use theme variables, so that they properly respond to theme changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing component styles THEN all hardcoded color classes (e.g., bg-slate-900, text-white) SHALL be replaced with theme-aware classes
2. WHEN a component uses background colors THEN it SHALL use semantic CSS variables (e.g., bg-background, bg-card)
3. WHEN a component uses text colors THEN it SHALL use semantic CSS variables (e.g., text-foreground, text-muted-foreground)
4. WHEN a component uses borders THEN it SHALL use the border CSS variable
5. WHEN a component has hover states THEN the hover colors SHALL also use theme variables
6. WHEN gradient backgrounds are used THEN they SHALL be defined with theme-aware color stops
7. WHEN components use backdrop blur effects THEN the background colors SHALL still respect theme variables

### Requirement 5: Light Theme Color Palette

**User Story:** As a user, I want a well-designed light theme, so that I can use the application comfortably in bright environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN light theme is active THEN the primary background SHALL be a light color (e.g., white or light gray)
2. WHEN light theme is active THEN the text SHALL be dark for proper contrast and readability
3. WHEN light theme is active THEN all UI elements SHALL maintain WCAG AA contrast ratios (minimum 4.5:1 for normal text)
4. WHEN light theme is active THEN accent colors SHALL be adjusted to work well on light backgrounds
5. WHEN light theme is active THEN shadows and borders SHALL be visible and provide adequate visual separation
6. WHEN light theme is active THEN the overall aesthetic SHALL feel cohesive and professional

### Requirement 6: Dark Theme Refinement

**User Story:** As a user, I want the existing dark theme to be refined and properly structured, so that it provides a consistent and polished experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dark theme is active THEN all existing visual styles SHALL be preserved or improved
2. WHEN dark theme is active THEN the color palette SHALL use the defined CSS variables
3. WHEN dark theme is active THEN gradient backgrounds SHALL maintain their visual appeal
4. WHEN dark theme is active THEN all decorative elements (glows, shadows) SHALL remain visible and effective
5. WHEN dark theme is active THEN text contrast SHALL meet WCAG AA standards

### Requirement 7: Theme Transition Animations

**User Story:** As a user, I want smooth transitions when switching themes, so that the change feels polished and not jarring.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the theme changes THEN color transitions SHALL animate smoothly over 200-300ms
2. WHEN the theme changes THEN the transition SHALL apply to background colors, text colors, and borders
3. WHEN the theme changes THEN the animation SHALL not cause layout shifts or content jumps
4. WHEN the theme changes THEN the transition SHALL feel responsive and not sluggish
5. IF a user has reduced motion preferences THEN theme transitions SHALL be instant without animation

### Requirement 8: Theme Persistence and Synchronization

**User Story:** As a user, I want my theme preference to be remembered across sessions, so that I don't have to reselect it every time I visit.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a theme THEN the preference SHALL be saved to localStorage immediately
2. WHEN a user returns to the application THEN their saved theme preference SHALL be applied automatically
3. WHEN a user opens the application in multiple tabs THEN theme changes SHALL synchronize across all tabs
4. WHEN localStorage is unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully fall back to system preference without errors
5. WHEN a user clears browser data THEN the theme SHALL reset to system preference on next visit
